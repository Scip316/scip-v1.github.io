TODO V2:

1.Bugs:
- nil for now


2) Implement:
- Diff pages for the table
- contact me with the icon and proper links



Nice to have:
1. Neccessary Features to be implemented:
- Make project page modular - long term easier to add projects and no need to hard code it as much
- Find a way to a) Keep the background the same when scrolling | b) change the background as your scroll. this relates to 3.
- Remove borders and drop shadow
- add Parallax effect where the project go into view
- Add pipeline for scanning (sonarcloud)
